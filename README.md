# 3D
A collection of my 3D designs

Multiple parts I've been designing to solve multiple problems, from malfunctioning headset microphones to PCB enclosures and whatever is needed in between.

I'll include all files necessary for 3D printing as well as images in case I have them available but I cannot guarantee I'll include CAD files given some of these models I might have created using non-traditional CAD programs, such as Blender, or I simply need more time and effort to offer a decently clean CAD project/file, please bear with me.
